AIMLPy
======

Ongoing python implementation of the AIML 1.0.1 specification

This project is meant to become a maintained version of pyaiml (aka program p)
that follows the latest aiml spec, allows embedded python aiml scripting, and
integrates better external library heuristics for natural language parsing.
